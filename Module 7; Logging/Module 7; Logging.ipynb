    "### Introduction\n",
    "As a programmer, you often check the status of the output of your code. Furthermore, it is often a good idea to check the status of variables at certain point in your code. In Python, this is often done with the function *print()*. While this is a good way of checking the status of variables or your output, it only exists in the environment (may it be a Python console, a terminal, an IDE or otherwise) you are working in. If you ever close the environment, the print statements are gone forever.\n",
