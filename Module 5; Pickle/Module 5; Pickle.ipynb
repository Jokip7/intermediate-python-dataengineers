    "### Introduction\n",
    "There are many different file types used in the data world. Main examples are .csv, .json and .xml, which are are easy to read and/or write, and are used extensively in multiple programming languages. However, sometimes you want to save a Python data object directly, such as a dictionary, list, tuple or even a fully trained machine learning algorithms created in Python. This is where the *pickle* module comes in.\n",

    "# Section 1: Pickle files\n",
    "\n",
    "Pickle is a very useful Python library. Pickle can be used to serialize Python object structures. Any object in Python can be pickled so that it can be saved on disk. So it's very specific to Python. This process of serializing Python object structures refers to the process of converting an object in the memory to a byte stream that can be stored as a binary file on disk. When we load it back to a Python program, this binary file can be de-serialized back to a Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides the fact that we can store Python objects, there is another advantage; its speed. Later in the module we'll focus a bit more on the speed of pickle, but let's look at an example below to get an idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll have to create an object that we can store. Then, we'll look at the speed differences between Pandas and Pickle in storing this object."

    "### **Theory - why use pickle?**\n",
    "Compared to other file types, it might be unclear at this point why we want to use pickle at all. Binary files aren't easy to read or use in general. So wouldn't it be more convenient to save data as a more generic file types such as XML, JSON or CSV?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is: it depends on what type of information you want to save and/or transfer. Pickle is meant as a convenient file type to transfer **Python objects** specifically between different systems, environments or pieces of Python code. It is the fastest and most efficient way to transport practically any(!) Python object."
